A Xposed Module for Localizing *Gakuen iDOLM@STER* to English.

It works by hooking into the game's text rendering system and replacing text during runtime.

This project includes a modified version of [gakuen-imas-localify](https://github.com/chinosk6/gakuen-imas-localify).

It is compatible only with the *Android* version of the game.
